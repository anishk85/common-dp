# Thor: A 6-Axis Robotic Arm with ROS 2 and AI

Welcome to the **Thor** project! This repository contains the complete software stack to build, simulate, and control a 6-axis robotic arm using ROS 2, MoveIt 2, and advanced AI capabilities with LeRobot. This project is designed to be a comprehensive platform for robotics research, learning, and development, from basic teleoperation to complex, AI-driven manipulation tasks.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Complete 6-Axis Arm:** A fully articulated 6-DoF robotic arm designed for manipulation tasks.
- **ROS 2 Humble Integration:** Built on the modern, stable ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill distribution.
- **Realistic Simulation:** High-fidelity Gazebo simulation for safe testing and development.
- **Advanced Motion Planning:** Full integration with MoveIt 2 for collision-aware trajectory planning.
- **Dual Teleoperation:** Control the robot in real-time using either:
  - Joint-based control for precise individual joint movements.
  - Pose-based (Cartesian) control to intuitively "fly" the end-effector.
- **Physical Hardware Interface:** A complete `ros2_control` hardware stack to bridge the software with physical motors and encoders using a Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
- **AI-Ready Data Collection:** A dedicated package for collecting high-quality, multi-camera demonstration data using a joystick, perfectly formatted for training AI policies with LeRobot.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The Thor project uses a modular architecture that separates simulation from hardware, allowing for seamless development and deployment.

- **High-Level Control (ROS 2 on Raspberry Pi):** Handles motion planning (MoveIt), teleoperation, and AI policy inference.
- **Low-Level Control (Firmware on Arduino):** Manages real-time tasks like reading encoders and running PID loops to drive the motors.
- **Communication:** The Raspberry Pi and Arduino communicate over a standard USB serial connection.

## üì¶ Package Overview

This workspace is organized into several key ROS 2 packages:

- **thor_urdf:** Contains the robot's 3D model (URDF/XACRO) and physical properties.
- **thor_moveit_config:** The configuration package for MoveIt 2, including the SRDF and planning pipelines.
- **thor_teleop:** Provides keyboard-based teleoperation nodes for both joint and pose control.
- **thor_hardware:** The crucial hardware interface package. Contains the C++ `ros2_control` driver, Arduino firmware, and launch files for the physical robot.
- **thor_learning:** The AI data collection package, featuring a powerful script for joystick-based teleoperation and synchronized multi-camera data recording for LeRobot.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Ubuntu 22.04** with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed.
- **MoveIt 2:**  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install ros-humble-moveit
  ```
- **ros2_control & Gazebo:**  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install ros-humble-ros2-control ros-humble-ros2-controllers ros-humble-gazebo-ros2-control
  ```
- **Colcon:** The standard ROS 2 build tool.
- **Python Dependencies (for AI):**  
  ```bash
  pip install h5py
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Clone this repository into your ROS 2 workspace's `src` folder.
   ```bash
   cd ~/your_ros2_ws/src
   git clone https://github.com/anishk85/common-dp.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Navigate to your workspace root and install any missing dependencies using `rosdep`.
   ```bash
   cd ~/your_ros2_ws
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
   ```

3. **Build the Workspace:**  
   Build all the packages using colcon.
   ```bash
   colcon build --symlink-install
   ```

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

> **Note:** Before running any command, always source your workspace in a new terminal:  
> `source install/setup.bash`

### 1. Running the Simulation (Gazebo)

This is the best way to test the robot's functionality without any hardware.

```bash
ros2 launch thor_urdf demo_gazebo.launch.py
```

This command will start Gazebo, spawn the Thor arm, and launch MoveIt, RViz, and all necessary controllers. You can now use the MoveIt RViz plugin to plan and execute motions.

### 2. Controlling the Physical Robot

#### A. Hardware Setup

- Ensure you have assembled the hardware as per the recommended stack (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, goBILDA motors).
- Upload the firmware from `thor_hardware/firmware` to your Arduino Mega.
- Connect the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi via USB.
- Power on the motor power supply.

#### B. Launching the Hardware

To start the drivers, `ros2_control`, and MoveIt for the physical robot, run the main hardware launch file:

```bash
ros2 launch thor_hardware hardware.launch.py
```

### 3. Using the Teleop Nodes

Once the simulation or the physical robot is running, you can control it using the keyboard. Open a new terminal and run one of the following commands:

- **For Joint-by-Joint Control:**
  ```bash
  ros2 run thor_teleop teleop_joint_control.py
  ```
- **For End-Effector Pose (Cartesian) Control:**
  ```bash
  ros2 run thor_teleop teleop_pose_control
  ```
  *(Note: This runs the C++ version, which is typically more performant).*

### 4. Collecting AI Data with LeRobot

Follow the detailed instructions in the `thor_learning/README.md` file to set up your cameras and joystick. The general launch sequence is:

- **Launch Hardware:**  
  ```bash
  ros2 launch thor_hardware hardware.launch.py
  ```
- **Launch Joystick:**  
  ```bash
  ros2 run joy joy_node
  ```
- **Launch Cameras:**  
  Start your camera drivers (e.g., `v4l2_camera_node`).
- **Launch Recorder:**  
  ```bash
  ros2 run thor_learning data_recorder.py
  ```

You can now use the joystick to control the arm and record demonstrations for training an AI policy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Guide

For a detailed list of recommended components and a complete wiring diagram, please refer to the documents generated during our development session. The two main hardware stacks are:

- **goBILDA DC Motor Stack:** Simpler assembly with integrated encoders (Recommended).
- **NEMA Stepper Motor Stack:** More powerful but requires complex assembly with external encoders.
