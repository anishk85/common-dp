[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmoveit_ros_py.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "moveit_ros_py", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "moveit_ros_py"
  with any of the following names:

    moveit_ros_pyConfig.cmake
    moveit_ros_py-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "moveit_ros_py" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "moveit_ros_py_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "moveit_ros_py" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
